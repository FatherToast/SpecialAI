1.1.3
    - Config file rebuilt, now allows separate chances per entity type.
    - Village modifications overhauled. Should reduce server overhead and greatly increase village stability.
    - Added /villageinfo command to make villages and the features added by this mod more understandable.
    - New dodge arrows AI.
    - New griefing target category, will not target loot containers until they have generated loot (i.e., until interacted with).
    - Spawner AI now causes the mobs it spawns to target the entity being targeted by the spawner mob, if possible.
    - Throw player AI now enters cooldown when the grab is escaped.
      - You need to get out of the grip multiple times to fully "escape".
    - Fiddling AI now ignites TNT.
    - Passive griefing break speed now defined by "GriefBreakSpeed" nbt tag.
    - Griefing range nbt tags renamed to "IdleScanRangeXZ" and "IdleScanRangeY".
1.1.2
    - Overhauled passive griefing AI to be much simpler. I recommend deleting all of your passive griefing configs before updating.
    - Added passive fiddling AI as a part of the griefing AI.
    - Thief "special" AI no longer transfers the stolen item directly into the thief's hand - should prevent some crashes.
    - Tweaked comments on config options to reflect changes in 1.1.1.
    - Tweaked some default griefing configs.
1.1.1
    - Added the ability to add entire namespaces to block lists using an asterisk (e.g. minecraft:* - don't actually do this one!).
    - Fixes any potential crashes related to EntityAIAvoid from within EntityAIThief.
1.1.0
    - The NBT update! Now loads most of its AI through the NBT tags on each mob.
    - New village options to make villagers a bit less laissez-faire. Greedy little jerks...
      - Improves village house mechanics.
      - Villagers will defend their village from attacks and players breaking its blocks.
      - You can gain reputation by killing monsters near the village and building houses.
      - You can lose reputation by breaking blocks in the village and destroying houses.
      - Fixes a vanilla bug where moving far from a village resets your reputation with it.
    - Added passive griefing target blacklist.
    - Added chance for depacified mobs to be aggressive instead of neutral.
    - Added Thief "special" AI pattern.
    - Mobs will now try to avoid explosions.
    - Mobs can now be given more than one "special" AI pattern at once (some AIs work better together than others).
    - Allows calling for help on a killing blow, so 1-shotting isn't 100% safe anymore.
    - Increased damage dealt by the barrage AI.
    - Mobs using charge, barrage, and leap AIs should now be a bit better at facing in the right direction.
    - Fixed grief AI to actually drop items when it is enabled in the config.
1.0.1
    - Block metadata is now separated by a space from the block id - still no spaces allowed elsewhere.
      - Fixes bug introduced in 1.7.10 that made mod blocks effectively impossible to mark as targets.
    - Fixed bug introtuced in 1.7.10 that allowed you to make mobs attempt to break air blocks.
      - Any invalid blocks on the target list will no longer count as air.
1.0.0
    - Initial release split off of Special Mobs 2.6.

      - Targeted blocks and the mobs that get the AI can be configured.
      - Creepers blow up instead of mining the blocks by default.
    - Carried over "special" AI patterns:
      - Charge, Jump, Leap, Ride (as a common AI), Shaman, Sprint, and Throw.
    - Added Barrage, Spawner, and Throw Player "special" AI patterns.
    - Improved "special" AI system to include tiered chances for specific mobs.
    - Carried over "screamer" AI - instead just affects everything always.
    - Carried over jockey system purely as AI.
    - Added "neutral" AI (makes normally passive mobs fight back when damaged).
    - Added "eat breeding items" AI.
