1.1.0
    - Replaced vanilla door-breaking ai with one that is more configurable and works (slightly) better.
    - Added randomized villager names.
    - Trampling farmland now counts as breaking it for purposes of reputation/aggression.
    - Fixed the modifiers applied to elite ai equipment.
    - Fixed missing .lang file; /villageinfo command should work again. Also added anti-cheese config for the command.

        - Added scan delay option for idle interaction ais.
        - Added missing option for thief's cap speed modifier.
        - Discontinued support for block "metadata" in preparation for 1.13.
        - Now uses blockstate property notation, which offers better control and is more readable.
        - Default block target lists are now autogenerated, so they can potentially pick up mod blocks.
