1.16.5-1.0.1
    - Config files will now only re-save on initial startup and when values are actually changed. Improves stability.
    - Now delays AI initialization until the first server tick. Hopefully prevents world load deadlock.
1.16.5-1.0.0
    - Rewritten and rebaselined for the MC 1.16.5 update.
    - Due to village reworks, all village-related features have been removed until I work out the new mechanics.
    - Uses the new TOML config format with runtime editing. These should be more user-friendly overall.
    - Many config options have been improved to allow better control.
        - Entity and block lists now always combine a blacklist with at least one whitelist.
        - Entity lists can now have a "default" entry (block lists still have "*" postfix).
    - Most values used by Elite AI patterns have been changed to pure config values.
        - The few values that could be NBT-edited can no longer be, with the exception of the Spawner AI.
        - Many more options are available now for Elite AIs, and they have been broken off into their own config file.
1.1.0
    - Replaced vanilla door-breaking ai with one that is more configurable and works (slightly) better.
    - Added randomized villager names.
    - Trampling farmland now counts as breaking it for purposes of reputation/aggression.
    - Fixed the modifiers applied to elite ai equipment.
    - Fixed missing .lang file; /villageinfo command should work again. Also added anti-cheese config for the command.
    - Changes to configs:
        - Added scan delay option for idle interaction ais.
        - Added missing option for thief's cap speed modifier.
        - Discontinued support for block "metadata" in preparation for 1.13.
        - Now uses blockstate property notation, which offers better control and is more readable.
        - Default block target lists are now autogenerated, so they can potentially pick up mod blocks.
1.0.1
    - Fixed NPE crashes.
1.0.0
    - Somewhat rewritten. Version reset, either way.
    - The feature "special ai" renamed to "elite ai" to reduce confusion.
    - Added a few additional options for tweaking the balance of elite ais.
    - Shaman ai now triggers every 2 seconds from 1 second.
    - Shaman ai potion effects now all tier I:
        - Damage reduction reduced to 20% from 40%, speed reduced to 30% from 60%.
    - Shaman ai default potion effects now save to nbt to serve as an example for nbt-editing them.
